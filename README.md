Sentiment Analysis API-
This project is a Sentiment Analysis API developed using Flask, designed to process customer reviews and determine their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). Leveraging the capabilities of the Groq API, the API accepts CSV or XLSX files containing customer reviews, performs sentiment analysis on each review, and returns a structured JSON response with sentiment scores. The API aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for businesses and developers looking to analyze customer feedback and improve their services. The implementation includes error handling for file uploads and integration with a large language model for accurate sentiment detection.
